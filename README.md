# Project Title: 
Make Chicago "Safe" Again

# Team Members: 
Luiz Veltze, Ryan Close, Tyler Mooney and Garrett Glissmann

# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to find interesting trends using Chicagoâ€™s crime reports spanning the years 2001 to early 2018. We will perform a longitudinal survey of crime trends. We hope to find geographical patterns as well as discover connections to other public health factors and socioeconomic indicators. For example, we could correlate crime with birth rates or access to affordable housing and grocery stores.

# Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers:
Are there any interesting correlations between crime rates in Chicago and socioeconomic or health data?

  - Example: is there a correlation between access to affordable housing and crime rates?
  
  - Example 2: is there a correlation between elevated blood level concentrations and crime rates?
  
What is the overall trend of crime since 2001? How about for specific types of crime such as homicide, sexual assault, or burglary?
When looking at the crimes longitudinally, are there specific outliers in terms of days of the year that have particularly high crime rates?

Given the overall trend in crime, can we fit a regression to the data for a rough estimation of the amount of future crime?

  - We discovered that over the last 18 years crime in chicago has trended down.

Is it possible to visualize or analyze the concentration of crime by community area in Chicago?


# Applications of Knowledge:
The most effective way that we can apply the knowledge that we have found would be to use the information to better inform law enforcement and public officials: 

  - Noticing a correlation between the average crime rate and the first day of the year/month could be useful for law enforcement to better prepare for the increase in criminal activity. 
  
  - Discovering that rehabilitation efforts in crime-heavy areas of the city can have a long-lasting positive impact on the crime-rate of the area could help appropriations committees to determine which areas of the city would benefit most from future improvements.
     
  - Finding that, over time, crime has become more isolated could help public officials to adjust funding for precincts based on the crime-rate, increasing funds and resources where they are most needed.
