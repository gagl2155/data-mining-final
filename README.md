# Project Title: 
Make Chicago "safe" again

# Team Members: 
Luiz Velzte, Ryan Close, Tyler Mooney and Garrett Glissmann

# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to find interesting trends using Chicagoâ€™s crime reports spanning the years 2001 to early 2018. We will perform a longitudinal survey of crime trends. We hope to find geographical patterns as well as discover connections to other public health factors and socioeconomic indicators. For example, we could correlate crime with birth rates or access to affordable housing and grocery stores.

# Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers:
Are there any interesting correlations between crime rates in Chicago and socioeconomic or health data?
  Example: is there a correlation between access to affordable housing and crime rates?
  Example 2: is there a correlation between elevated blood level concentrations and crime rates?
What is the overall trend of crime since 2001? How about for specific types of crime such as homicide, sexual assault, or burglary?
When looking at the crimes longitudinally, are there specific outliers in terms of days of the year that have particularly high crime rates?
Given the overall trend in crime, can we fit a regression to the data for a rough estimation of the amount of future crime?
Is it possible to visualize or analyze the concentration of crime by community area in Chicago?
